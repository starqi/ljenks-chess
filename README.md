TODO

- Can replace aggression eval with handler as well, saving move allocation
- Promotions and checks should be marked - not quiet!
- UI: Disallow fake premoves
- Replace hash map coords
- En passant + old board state
- Investigate Webpack Wasm generation
- Debug build, put logs inside debug
- Lazy evaluation with incremental material heuristic, maybe also with control squares?
- Personal musings - recursive null-move-ish evaluations  
- Unit tests
